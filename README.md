# Image-Transformation-tool
Image Transformation means taking an image as input and giving an image as output with similar or entirely different features by applying required transformations. There are different types of transformations like affine transformation Fourier transformations etc. Image transformations is playing vital role in many fields of study these days, one of them is in Geographical Information System(GIS).A Geographic Information System or Geographical Information System (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyse, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data .In GIS images are taken through different sources, which need to be transformed for getting required information, The following software helps in transforming an image using different function to get the required data from the image .Software can handle conversion of from one format to another ,scaling of the image, resizing of the image, cropping of the image, slicing of the image, changing the projection of the image from one projection to another and translation of image by using control points. All these transformation are very important in GIS field for getting the required data from the image .Software can apply these type of transformations not only on single image but also on batch of images at once, but at one time only one type of transformation can be applied to the batch files .Software is developed using C# as User Interface, gdal and Imagemagick libraries are used as for the functions .Some of the example transformations which are done by the Software are given below. This is the first version of the software and many more transformation functions will be applied in the following versions
